# NetzschChat
This is a basic chat solution created as a preinterview task for Netzsch 

Since the task description says that I am free to apply my personal assumptions I decided to implement a chat system.

Solution consists from a REST api service and a WPF client. I was not able to complete web client in time unfortunately. 
My estimates for this kind af a project were incorrect. 
But I decided to share everything I have completed till 17.10.2023 with you.

In sources you will find a backend REST api project "Netzsch.Api" and WPF desktop client "Netzsch.Wpf".
Both could be started in Visual Studio or with a simple "dotnet run" command from the command line.

1. Start rest api service.
2. Start first WPF app and register user "user1@google.com". 
3. Start second WPF app and register user "user2@google.com". 

Once users are registered you can start a chat and send messages between users. 

Thank you for your task and your time.
